subtitle: Fucked more than Twitter

The first thing was letting the nazis in.

The second thing was breaking it by sacking people.

The next thing was the blue tick.

The next thing was crap features.

The next thing was awful desperate ads.

The next thing was telling advertisers to fuck off.

## We all know what a horrible shite he is… but...

The thing he really knackered was people, in one place, and the whole urge to bother tweeting. Almost everyone I know has fled Twitter, a few have tried other tools...

- Some have tried Threads, but that’s run by an idiot happy to let self-harm materials on his sites, and Facebook is now just the home of fascist grans.
- Some tried Bluesky, but with it’s invite barrier to entry, it’s dead and dull.
- Some tried Mastadon, but that seems to be the realm of geeks. I should be geeky enough for it, but I just can’t find anybody...

But mainly, the thought of tweeting just seems like a stupid idea. Narcissistic, inviting pile-ons from armies of the brain dead and bots. Why would anyone bother any more?
